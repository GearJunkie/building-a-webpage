            <p>Welcome to this introduction to software development. This website will provide the fundamental information to start coding websites. The aim is not to take you from &quot;beginner&quot; to &quot;expert&quot; but to take you from &quot;beginner&quot; to &quot;comfortable.&quot; From there, you should be able to start making your own way, learning from other resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge. If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging. This guide will provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics properly.</p>
            <a id="What_is_HTML?"></a>
            <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
            <p>HTML &lpar;Hypertext Markup Language&rpar; is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document &lpar;Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?&rpar;, structure a document &lpar;Does it have a header? Three colums of content? A navigation menu?&rpar;, and embed contenct such as images and video into a page. For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
            <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
            <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph &lt;p&gt; element:</p>
            <p>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</p>
            <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element:</h3>
            <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png">
            <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element, p for paragraph, wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. It precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
                <li>The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
                <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
            </ul>
                </p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
            <h3>Nesting elements:</h3>
            <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to have strong&lpar;er&rpar; text formatting:
            <p>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.</p>
            <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before closing the p</p>
            <h3>Block versus inline elements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.</li>
                <li>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the document’s content &lpar;not entire paragraphs or groupings of content&rpar;. An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an &lt;a&gt; element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; create emphasis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;p&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fifth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sixth&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;em&gt; is an inline element. As you see below, the first three elements sit on the same line, with no space in between . On the other hand, &lt;p&gt; is a block-level element. Each p element appears on a new line, with space above and below.</p>
            <p><em>firstsecondthird</em></p>
            <p>fourth</p><p>fifth</p><p>sixth</p>
            <h3>Empty elements:</h3>
            <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert or embed something in the document. For example, the &lt;img&gt; element embeds an image file onto a page:</p>
            <p>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"&gt;
            <p>This would output the following:</p>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png">
            <h3>Attributes:</h3>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png">
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
            <p>An attribute should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A space between it and the element name. &lpar;For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.&rpar;</li>
                <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Adding attributes to an element:</h3>
            <p>Another example of an element is &lt;a&gt;. This stands for anchor. An anchor can make the text it encloses into a hyperlink. Anchors can take a number of attributes, but several are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>href: This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link &lpar;href="https://www.google.com/"&rpar;.</li>
                <li>Title: The title attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as a description of the page that is being linked to. For example, title="The Google Homepage". This appears as the tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.</li>
                <li>Target: The target attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link. For example: target="_blank" will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Live output:</p>
            <p>A link to my <a href="https://www.google.com/" title="The Google Homepage" target="_blank">favorite website</a>.</p>
            <p>Editable code:</p>
            <p>&lt;p&gt;A link to my &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/" title="The Google Homepage" target=_blank"&gt;favorite website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            <h3>Anatomy of an HTML document:</h3>
            <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:</p>
            <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p><p>&lt;html&gt;</p><p>&lt;head&gt;</p><p>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</p><p>&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;/head&gt;</p><p>&lt;body&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;/body&gt;</p><p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
            <p>Here we have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The doctype: The doctype is a historical artifact that NEEDS to be included for everything else to work right. That is all you need to know!</li>
                <li>The &lt;html&gt; element: This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
                <li>The &lt;head&gt; element: This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, characer set declarations, and more.</li>
                <li>The &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;: This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.</li>
                <li>&lt;title&gt;: This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.</li>
                <li>&lt;body&gt;: This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, video, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Entity references; Including special character in HTML:</h3>
            <p>in HTML, the characters &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, and &amp; are special characters. They are parts of the HTML syntax itself. So we need to use character references, special codes that represent characters, to be used in these exact circumstances. each character reference starts with an ampersand &lpar;&&rpar;, and ends with a semicolon &lpar;;&rpar;.</p>
            <img src="https://devpractical.com/public/04/special-characters-html.png">
            <p>Example code: &lt;p&gt;In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            <p>Live output: In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
            <p>There are many other entity referenes to use in HTML.</p>
            <h3>HTML comments:</h3>
            <p>HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates. To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers &lt;!-- and --&gt;.</p>
            <p>Example: <p>&lt;p&gt;This is not inside a comment&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;But this is!&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;</p>
            <!-- This is an HTML Comment-->

                <a id="Styling_HTML_with_CSS"></a>
                <h2>Styling HTML with CSS</h2>
                    <p>CSS &lpar;Cascading Style Sheets&rpar; is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users &lpar;how they are styled, laid out, etc.&rpar;. You can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling. For example… 1. Changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout. 2. Turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.</p>
                    <img src="https://learnwebcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/anatomy-of-a-css-rule.gif">
                <h3>CSS syntax:</h3>
                    <p>CSS is a rule-based language. You define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example, you want the main heading of your page to be shown as large red text…</p>
                    <p>h1 {</p><p>color: red;</p><p>font-size: 5em</p><p>}</p>
                    <p>The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings &lpar;&lt;h1&gt;&rpar;. We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element&lpar;s&rpar; we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property. Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.</p>
                <h3>CSS modules:</h3>
                    <p>There is so much styling with CSS, that it is broken down into modules. For example, you could take a look at the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains. At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to find information if you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification.</p>
                <h3>Styling HTML elements:</h3>
                    <p>By making our heading red, we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this y targeting an <em>element selector</em>. This is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma.</p>
                    <p>Example: p, li {</p>
                    <p>color: green;</p>
                    <p>}</p>
                <h3>Adding a class:</h3>
                    <p>So far, we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so you wil lneed to find a weay to select a subset of the elements withought changing the others. The most common way to do this, is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class. In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like this:</p>
                    <p>&lt;ul&gt;</p><p>&lt;li&gt;Item one&lt;/li&gt;</p><p>&lt;li class="special"&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;</p><p>&lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;li&gt;</p><p>&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
                    <p>In your CSS you can target the class of &quot;special&quot; by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS file:</p>
                    <p>.special {</p><p>color: orange;</p><p>font-weight: bold;</p><p>}</p>
                    <p>You can apply the class of &quot;special&quot; to any element on your page that you want to have the same look as this list item. For example, you might want the &lt;span&gt; in the paragraph to also be orange and bold.</p>
                <h3>Styling things based on their location in a document:</h3>
                    <p>There are times when you will want something to look different based on where it is in the document. There are a number of selectors that can help you here, but for now we will look at just a couple. In a document with two &lt;em&gt; elements, one inside a paragraph and the other inside a list item. To select only an &lt;em&gt; that is nested inside an &lt;li&gt; element Iyou can use a selector called the <em>descendant combinator</em>, which takes the form of a space between two other selectors.</p>
                    <p>li em {</p><p>color: rebeccapurple;</p><p>}</p>
                    <p>This selector will select any &lt;em&gt; element that is inside an &lt;li&gt;. So in your example, you should find that the &lt;em&gt; in the third list item is now purple, but the one inside the paragraph is unchanged.</p>
                <h3>Styling things based on state:</h3>
                    <p>An example of this is when styling links. When we style a link, we need to target the &lt;a&gt; element. This has different states depending on whether it is unvisited, visited, being hovered over, focused via keyboard, or in the process of being clicked &lpar;activated&rpar;. You can use CSS to target these different states.</p>
                    <p>a:link {</p><p>color: pink;</p><p>}</p><p>a:visited {</p><p>color: green;</p><p>}</p>
                    <p>You can change the way the link looks when the user hovers over it, for example, removing the underline, which is achieved by:</p>
                    <p>a:hover {</p><p>text-decoration: none;</p><p>)</p>
                <h3>Combining selectors and combinators:</h3>
                    <p>It is worth noting that you can combine multiple selectors and combinators together. You can combine multiple types together too.</p>
                    <p>body h1 + p .special {</p><p>color:yellow;</p><p>background-color: black;</p><p>padding: 5px;</p><p>}</p>
                    <p>This will style any element with a class of &quot;special&quot;, which is inside a &lt;p&gt;, which comes just after an &lt;h1&gt;, which is inside a &lt;body&gt;. Whew!</p>
                <h3>Inline styles:</h3>
                    <p>Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained withing a style attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document looks like:</p>
                    <p>&lt;body&gt;</p><p>&lt;h1 style="color:blue;background-color: yetllow;border: 1px solid black;"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;</p><p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>
                    <p>Avoid using CSS in this way when possible. It is not best practice.</p>
                <h3>Selectors:</h3>
                    <p>A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content. If CSS is not applying to content as expected, your selector may not match the way you think it should match. Each CSS rule starts with a selector or list of selectors, in order to tell the browser which element&lpar;s&rpar; the rules should apply to.</p>
                <h3>Properties and values:</h3>
                    <p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Properties: Thesse are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify, such as font-size, width, background-color</li>
                        <li>Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The property name below is color and the value is blue.</p>

                <h3>Comments:</h3>
                    <p>As with any coding, it is best practice to write comments along with CSS. This helps you to remember how the code works as you come back later for fixes or enhancement. It also helps others understand the code. CSS comments begin with /* and end with */.</p>

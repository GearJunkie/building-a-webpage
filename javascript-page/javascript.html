        <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
          <p>Javascript is a programming language that is primarily known for programming web pages. Anytime that a webpage is more than just a static page it's probably because of Javscript; it adds a layer of interactivity to web pages. Take a button for example. With HTML it is possible to put text in the button, and with CSS it is possible to style it to look like a button. Javscript would allow one to click the button.</p>

  <h2>Javscript Expressions and Operators</h2>
  <p>
    Javscript has many operators which are used to create programs. Common operators are assignment operators, which assign a value to a variable. The following is a table of common assignment operators:

    <table style="width:80%">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Operator</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Assignment</td>
        <td>x = y</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Addition Assignment</td>
        <td>x += y</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Subtraction Assignment</td>
        <td>x -= y</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Multiplication Assignment</td>
        <td>x *= y</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Divisions Assignment</td>
        <td>x /= y</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Remainder Assignment</td>
        <td>x %= y</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    In addition to assignment operators there are also comparison operators. These operators compare two values and return a result based on the comparison. The following is a table of common comparison operators:
    <br><br>
    <table style="width:80%">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Equal (==)</td>
        <td>Returns true if operands are equal</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Not Equal (!=)</td>
        <td>Returns true if operands are not equal/td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Strict Equal (===)</td>
        <td>Returns true if the value of the operands are equal</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Strict Not Equal (!==)</td>
        <td>Returns true if the value of the operands is not equal</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Greater Than (>)</td>
        <td>Returns true if the if left operand is greater than the right operand</td>
      </tr> 
      <tr>
        <td>Greater Than or equal (>=)</td>
        <td>Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Less Than (>)</td>
        <td>Returns true if the if left operand is less than the right operand</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Less Than or equal (<=>)</td>
        <td>Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>

  <h2>Javascript Functions</h2>
    <p>
      A function is a basic building block of a Javascript program. An example of a function is as follows:

      <pre>
        <code>
          function square(number) {return number * number;}
        </code>
      </pre>

      
      A function declaration must consist of the function keyword and the following three things:
      
      The name of the function
      Parameters, enclosed in parentheses
      Javascript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces
      In the function example above the name of the function is square, the parameter is number and the Javascript statement is {return number * number;}.
      
      To call the above function one would type the following:
      
      square(5)
    </p>

  <h2>Javascript Loops</h2>
  <p>
    A loop is a way to allow one to run code a certain number of times. A loops looks like the following:

    <pre>
      <code>
        for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {console.log('Walking east one step');}
      </code>
    </pre>

    The above code will log "Waking east one step" to the console five times. The way this works is by setting the initial loop variable step to 0. The code then runs and when it is finished the step variable is incremented by 1, making the the step value 1. This code will continue to run so long as step is less than 5. Once step equals 5 the loop is exited.
